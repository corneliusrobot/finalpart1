Requirements
Draft a well-formed problem statement relevant to a business problem affecting your team, division, or organization.

Problem: People generally don't understand the reasons for their insurance premiums. They accept the rates they're given without a real understanding as to why. 

The data that Kaggle has prepared, along with Census data that can provide deeper demographic information, potentially offers a window into demographic and ethnic variants that may impact people's health insurance rates. 

Goal: Identify potential demographic determinants to insurance premiums and order them by degree of impact.

Risks or limitations: The data available may not identify a strong enough causal relationsihp. 

The dataset from Kaggle is provided in the exercise, Census data is publicly available along with enhanced data sets available on github, and I have access to internal data sets that I can acquire permission to use for this project.
